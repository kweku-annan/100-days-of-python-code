INSTRUCTIONS
You are painting a wall. The instruction on the paint can says that 1 can of paint can cover 5 square meters of wall.
Given a random height and width of wall, calculate how many cans of paint you'll need to buy.

number of cans = (wall height * wall width) / coverage per can.

e.g. Height = 2, Width = 4, Coverage = 5.
number of cans = (2 * 4) / 5
            = 1.6.
Make sure you round the answer to the nearest whole number

    number_of_cans = round((height * width) / cover)
    print(f"You will need {number_of_cans} number of cans.")


test_h = int(input("Height of wall: "))
test_w = int(input("Width of wall: "))
coverage = 5
